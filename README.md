It is a front-end-only project designed for learning and practicing web development skills.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes, with the preference saved in localStorage.
- **Profile Page**: Includes a cover image, user details, and posts.
- **Post Containers**: Styled containers for posts with activity icons (like, comment, share).
- **Sidebars**: Left and right sidebars for navigation and additional content.
